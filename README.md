# Keizer Internet Website

This is the repository that builds/generates the [keizer internet](http://keizerinternet.com) website.

The site itself is hosted on [github pages](https://pages.github.com) to ease hosting a website.

It is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io) which is a markdown to static site generation framework. All the content and pages are written in markdown. Please see [hugos documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/usage/) for more details and information.

Commits (saved changes) to the `master` branch are automatically built and deployed to the `gh-pages` branch (github pages hosted branch) via [wercker](https://www.wercker.com)
