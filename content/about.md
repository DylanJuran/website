KeizerInternet.com is the official website for updates on the Keizer Internet project.

The Keizer Internet Project advocates for a free and open internet for Keizer citizens. We believe the best way to ensure a free and open internet is by creating a publicly funded, city-wide network utility service.

The Keizer Internet Project is founded by Dylan Juran and Daniel Miedema. We are citizens of Keizer who are passionate about internet freedom and the internetâ€™s powerful role in our lives. We are both eager to visit with people in the community about Net Neutrality, the open internet, and how technology is used in our community and how we hope it is used in the future.
